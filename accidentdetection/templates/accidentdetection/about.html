      <p>
        Accident Detection System is an application that uses computer vision
        and machine learning techniques to detect and classify road accidents in
        real time. The system can process live video feeds from cameras
        installed in different locations on the road network, and can detect
        various types of accidents, including collisions, rollovers, and other
        types of incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system uses deep learning algorithms to analyze video frames in real
        time, and can automatically generate alerts and notifications to
        emergency services, such as police, ambulance, and fire departments. The
        system can also provide real-time updates to traffic management centers
        and other stakeholders, helping them to quickly respond to accidents and
        minimize the impact on traffic flow and safety.
